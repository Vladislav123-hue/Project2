# 🧮 SIMPLE MATH

**SIMPLE MATH** is a clean, browser-based calculator designed to help users perform everyday math operations with ease. Whether you're a student, professional, or just someone who needs quick calculations, this tool is for you. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, SIMPLE MATH offers a user-friendly interface and responsive design for all screen sizes.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how pure JavaScript can be used to build interactive, real-world applications. SIMPLE MATH is ideal for those who want a fast and reliable calculator without the need to install apps or rely on complex software.

## Technologies Used

Here’s a list of the core technologies used to build the **Simple Math** website:

**Frontend:**

● **HTML5** – Used to structure the content and create the overall layout of the website.

● **CSS** – Responsible for styling the website and ensuring it looks visually appealing.
● **Flexbox** – Used for responsive layout and ensuring the design adapts to different
screen sizes.

● **JavaScript** – Powers the interactive functionality of the calculator, handles user inputs, updates the display, processes mathematical operations, and manages expression evaluation dynamically in real time.
● **Media Queries** – Employed to handle responsiveness across various devices
(desktop, tablet, mobile).

**Version Control:**

● **Git** – Used for version control to track and manage changes in the project.

● **GitHub** – Hosted the code repository and provides a platform for collaboration and version
history.

**Hosting & Deployment:**

● **GitHub Pages** – Used for free static website hosting, allowing easy deployment of the
TrainBrain website directly from the GitHub repository.
